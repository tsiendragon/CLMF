# CLMF: Cascaded Localization with Multi-Feature Integration for Robust Deepfake Detection

## Project Documentation

### 📋 Plans & Design
- [Research Proposal](docs/idea_qian_20250808.md)
- [Project Plan](docs/plan.md) ⭐ - Complete project execution plan with research methodology

### 🚀 Quick Start

#### Environment Setup
```bash
# Python >= 3.10, conda environment recommended
conda create -n clmf python=3.10
conda activate clmf
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🎯 Five Core Research Questions

1. **Feature Importance**: Which features are most effective for detection?
2. **Fusion Strategy**: Which fusion method performs optimally?
3. **Evaluation Standard**: How to evaluate practical application effects using FAR@FRR metrics?
4. **Localization**: How to design loss functions for precise localization?
5. **Data Optimization**: How to improve robustness through synthesis and augmentation?

### 📊 Project Status
